Keycloak is an open-source Identity and Access Management solution that provides features such as Single Sign-On, Social
Login, User Federation, and Multi-factor Authentication. It is often used to secure applications and services by
providing a centralized authentication and authorization mechanism.

In the context of Keycloak, a realm is a logical grouping of users, applications, and services. A realm can be thought
of as a security domain, and it defines the boundaries within which security policies and authentication mechanisms are
enforced.

When you create a realm in Keycloak, you can define various settings such as authentication providers, client
applications, roles, and users. Each realm has its own set of configurations, and users, roles, and other entities
defined in one realm are isolated from other realms.

In summary, a realm in Keycloak is a logical container that provides a security context for authentication and
authorization. It allows administrators to define security policies, manage users and roles, and secure applications and
services.
